#ðŸŽ¯Problem Statement
Homeowners and students often face the challenge of high electricity bills without a clear way to understand the specific causes. Standard utility reports typically lack the detailed, appliance-level data needed to pinpoint the main drivers of consumption. This information gap makes it difficult for users to take targeted, effective actions to manage their energy use, leading to unnecessary financial strain and preventable energy waste.

#ðŸ’¡Proposed Solution
An AI-powered Smart Home Energy Advisor Agent is designed to provide clear and actionable insights into household electricity usage. Built on IBM Cloud Lite and leveraging the analytical capabilities of IBM's Granite AI models, this agent will:
-Analyse energy consumption data, manually entered by the user, to identify usage patterns and trends.

-Engage users in a natural language conversation, allowing them to ask questions like, "Why was my bill so high?" or "Which appliance used the most energy last week?".

-Deliver personalised recommendations based on the user-provided data to help them identify wasteful habits and optimise their energy use.

-Provide a simple, student-friendly interface to make energy management straightforward and accessible.
